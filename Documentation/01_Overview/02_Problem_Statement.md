# 02 – Problem Statement

Selecting appropriate clothing combinations is a complex decision problem involving subjective and contextual variables.

The challenge can be formalized as:

Given:
- A set of garments
- Contextual information (occasion)
- User preference signals

Determine:
- A ranked set of outfit combinations
- With explanation
- Adapted over time to user feedback

The difficulty arises from:

1. Multi-color garments
2. Context variability
3. Material interactions
4. Subjective aesthetic perception
5. Dynamic user preference evolution

Traditional rule-based systems are insufficient due to ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, a hybrid approach combining fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning is required.
