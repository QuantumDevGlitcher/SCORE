# 01 – Project Introduction

## 1. Project Name

SCORE  
Smart Context-aware Outfit Recommendation Engine

---

## 2. Project Summary

SCORE is an intelligent system designed to analyze clothing items and recommend outfit combinations based on context, aesthetic compatibility, and user feedback. **The implementation includes trained weights for the garment recognition models, allowing for immediate inference without requiring the original training dataset.**

The system integrates:

- Computer Vision (garment and color recognition)
- Rule-based and fuzzy scoring
- Context-aware decision logic
- Reinforcement-based personalization

The primary goal is to assist users in selecting coherent outfit combinations adapted to specific occasions such as university, presentations, gym sessions, or formal events.

## 3. Motivation

Clothing selection is a multi-factor decision problem involving:

- Color compatibility
- Material compatibility
- Context suitability
- Personal preference
- Social expectations

Most users rely on intuition rather than structured reasoning. SCORE formalizes this decision process into a computational system capable of explaining its recommendations.

## 4. Target Audience

- University students
- Individuals seeking structured outfit guidance
- Academic evaluators assessing intelligent system design

---

## 5. Academic Context

This project is developed for the course:

DVA-514 – Intelligent Systems

It demonstrates the integration of:

- Machine Learning
- Fuzzy Logic
- Reinforcement Learning
- Clean Software Architecture
