# 01 – Development Methodology

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the development approach used for SCORE.

Although SCORE is an academic project,
it is developed following professional engineering practices
to simulate real-world software architecture standards.

---

## 2. Methodology Approach

SCORE follows a hybrid methodology:

- Structured architectural planning (front-loaded design)
- Iterative implementation cycles
- Incremental validation

This avoids:

- chaotic coding
- uncontrolled feature expansion
- architectural drift

---

## 3. Development Phases

### Phase 1 – Architectural Definition
- Define Clean Architecture structure
- Define module boundaries
- Define scoring logic
- Define data contracts

### Phase 2 – Core Implementation
- Implement domain entities
- Implement scoring engine
- Implement fuzzy rules
- Implement recommendation use cases

### Phase 3 – Vision Integration
- Implement training pipeline
- Integrate classification inference
- Connect perception to domain objects

### Phase 4 – User Interfaces
- CLI module
- GUI module
- Input validation

### Phase 5 – Personalization
- Implement reinforcement weight update
- Persist preferences
- Validate stability

### Phase 6 – Testing and Hardening
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Edge-case validation
- Performance checks

---

## 4. Iterative Strategy

Each phase is developed in short internal cycles:

1. Implement minimal working version
2. Validate correctness
3. Refactor for clarity
4. Add complexity only if necessary

This prevents premature optimization.

---

## 5. Scope Control

To prevent feature creep:

- Segmentation is deferred
- Body modeling is deferred
- Advanced RL is deferred

Only features within the defined scope are implemented.

---

## 6. Team Structure

The project assumes:

- Shared repository
- Defined module responsibilities
- Coordinated integration

Core module remains the single source of truth.

---

## 7. Architectural Discipline

Key principle:

Implementation must not violate Clean Architecture boundaries.

Specifically:

- UI cannot import infrastructure logic directly
- Core cannot depend on GUI or CLI
- Domain layer remains pure

---

## 8. Documentation-Driven Development

Documentation precedes implementation.

This ensures:

- clarity before coding
- alignment across team members
- reduced refactoring overhead

---

## 9. Risk Mitigation

Risks addressed through:

- modular design
- dependency isolation
- lightweight model selection
- local execution constraints

---

## 10. Summary

SCORE development is:

- architecturally planned
- iteratively implemented
- scope-controlled
- documentation-driven

The goal is not just to build a system,
but to build it correctly.
